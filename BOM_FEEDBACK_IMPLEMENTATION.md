# BOM Feedback Implementation Guide

## Overview
The BOM Accuracy Score has been changed from tracking "projects with material data" to tracking "projects with error-free BOMs". This provides a quality metric instead of just a completion metric.

## Logic Change

### Old Logic (Data Completion)
- **Measured**: % of projects that have material data entered (oak_m3, sw_m3, or frame_price)
- **Problem**: Didn't measure BOM quality or accuracy

### New Logic (Quality Tracking)
- **Measures**: % of projects with error-free BOMs
- **How it works**:
  - Empty or null `bom_feedback` = BOM is error-free ✅
  - Text in `bom_feedback` = BOM has errors reported by production ❌
- **Metric renamed**: "Error-Free BOM Rate" (instead of "BOM Accuracy Score")

## Database Changes

### New Column: `bom_feedback`
```sql
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bom_feedback TEXT;
COMMENT ON COLUMN projects.bom_feedback IS 'BOM error feedback - empty means error-free, text indicates issues';
```

## Application Changes

### 1. Data Model (app.js line ~451)
Added `bomFeedback` field to load from database:
```javascript
bomFeedback: p.bom_feedback,
```

### 2. UI Component (app.js line ~1683)
Added BOM Feedback card in project detail sidebar:
- Positioned after Material & Cost section
- Before Brief Feedback section
- Shows textarea in edit mode
- Shows "No BOM errors reported - error-free ✅" in view mode when empty
- Includes helpful hint about leaving empty for error-free BOMs

### 3. Save Function (app.js line ~3781)
Added BOM feedback to save operation:
```javascript
const bomFeedback = document.getElementById('bomFeedback');
if (bomFeedback) updates.bom_feedback = bomFeedback.value || null;
```

### 4. KPI Calculation (app.js line ~3126)
Changed calculation logic:
```javascript
// Old: Count projects with material data
const projectsWithBOM = filteredProjects.filter(p => 
    p.oakM3 || p.swM3 || p.framePrice
).length;

// New: Count projects with error-free BOMs
const projectsWithErrorFreeBOM = filteredProjects.filter(p => 
    !p.bomFeedback || p.bomFeedback.trim() === ''
).length;
```

### 5. Reports Page Label (app.js line ~2384)
- Changed from: "BOM Accuracy Score"
- Changed to: "Error-Free BOM Rate"
- Status messages updated:
  - High quality: "✅ High quality"
  - Low quality: "⚠️ Quality issues detected"

## How to Apply Database Changes

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Migration
1. Open the file `add_kpi_columns.sql`
2. Copy ALL the SQL content
3. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** button

### Step 3: Verify Changes
Run this query to confirm the column exists:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'projects' 
AND column_name = 'bom_feedback';
```

Should return:
```
column_name   | data_type
--------------+-----------
bom_feedback  | text
```

## Usage Guide

### For Project Managers
1. **Open any project** in detail view
2. **Click Edit** button
3. **Scroll to "BOM Feedback" section** (below Material & Cost)
4. **Leave empty** if production found no errors
5. **Add notes** if production team reported any issues
6. **Click Save**

### Examples

#### Error-Free BOM (Empty Feedback)
```
BOM Feedback: [empty]
```
✅ This project counts toward the Error-Free BOM Rate

#### BOM with Errors (Has Feedback)
```
BOM Feedback: "Missing 3x M12 bolts in hardware list. Fascia board quantity incorrect."
```
❌ This project does NOT count toward the Error-Free BOM Rate

### Interpreting the Metric

**Error-Free BOM Rate: 85%**
- 85% of projects had BOMs with no errors reported by production
- 15% of projects had BOM errors that needed correction

**Target**: Aim for >90% error-free rate
- High rates indicate excellent BOM quality and attention to detail
- Low rates suggest need for additional quality checks before sign-off

## Benefits of This Change

### Old System
- Only tracked if material data was entered
- Couldn't identify which projects had quality issues
- No feedback loop from production to design

### New System
✅ Tracks actual BOM quality, not just data entry
✅ Provides actionable feedback for improvement
✅ Identifies patterns: which designers/project types have more errors
✅ Creates feedback loop between production and design teams
✅ Helps improve processes to prevent recurring errors

## Technical Notes

### Existing Projects
- All existing projects will have `null` in `bom_feedback`
- They will initially count as "error-free" (100% accurate)
- Add feedback as production issues are discovered

### Empty String vs Null
- Both are treated as "error-free"
- Code checks: `!p.bomFeedback || p.bomFeedback.trim() === ''`

### Data Privacy
- BOM feedback is stored in the `projects` table
- Same RLS policies apply as other project fields
- Visible to all users who can view the project

## Testing Checklist

After applying the database migration:

- [ ] Refresh the application
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Open any project in detail view
- [ ] Click Edit button
- [ ] Verify "BOM Feedback" section appears (with 📋 icon)
- [ ] Enter some test feedback text
- [ ] Click Save
- [ ] Verify feedback persists after save
- [ ] Leave feedback empty on another project
- [ ] Go to Reports Dashboard
- [ ] Check "Error-Free BOM Rate" metric
- [ ] Verify projects with empty feedback count as error-free
- [ ] Verify projects with text in feedback don't count

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify database column was created (see Step 3 above)
3. Ensure you refreshed the app after applying database changes
4. Check that RLS policies allow reading/writing `bom_feedback`
